# jc://modules/

This collection consists of several JavaScript-modules that are share over my projects which are partly available here, e.g. jc://mbox/. The modules are:

* _jc-app:_ class to send requests to a REST-API
* _jc-cookie:_ class to save and read cookies
* _jc-msg:_ class to create alerts or confirm messages as an overlay
* _jc-player:_ class to create a simple HTML5 player
* _jc-upload:_ not ready jet
* _jc-boxes:_ not ready jet

## Disclaimer

At the moment this modules are build to work for my software projects and may help you for your projects also. My intention is to make them easily usable for other projects also.
